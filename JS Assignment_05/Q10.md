Q.10 How do you define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async/await?

Ans:  To define an asynchronous function using `async/await` in JavaScript, we simply need to add the `async` keyword before the function declaration. This allows us to use the `await` keyword within the function to pause the execution until a promise is resolved. It provides a more synchronous-like way to write asynchronous code, making it easier to read and understand.
