Q.7 Whatâ€™s Async & Await Keyword in JavaScript?

Ans:  Async is used to declare a function as asynchronous, allowing the use of await within the function. It automatically returns a promise.

Await is used to pause the execution of an async function until a promise settles. It waits for the promise to resolve and returns the resolved value. If the promise is rejected, it throws an error that can be caught using a try...catch block.

Together, async and await simplify the syntax for working with promises, making asynchronous code appear more sequential and easier to read. They help avoid callback hell and improve error handling by leveraging the inherent nature of promises in a synchronous-like manner.
