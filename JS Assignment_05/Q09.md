Q.9 Whats fetch in JavaScript?

Ans: In JavaScript, `fetch` is a built-in function used to make HTTP requests and retrieve data from a network. It returns a Promise that resolves to the response from the server. With `fetch`, we can send asynchronous requests, handle the responses, and process the retrieved data. It supports different HTTP methods and allows us to pass additional options like headers and request body. `fetch` simplifies AJAX requests and is widely used for data fetching and API integration in JavaScript applications.
