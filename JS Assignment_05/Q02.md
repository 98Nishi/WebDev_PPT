Q.2 Explain Web Apis.

Ans:Web APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, facilitate communication and interaction between different software applications over the internet. They provide a standardized set of rules and protocols for developers to access the functionalities and data of other applications or services. Web APIs are based on REST principles and use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources. We can make requests to API endpoints to retrieve data, perform actions, and integrate with third-party services. Web APIs play a crucial role in modern web development, allowing for the creation of interconnected systems and the seamless exchange of information between applications. They utilize structured data formats like JSON or XML and often require authentication for secure access. Web APIs empower developers to build powerful and innovative applications by leveraging the functionalities and data offered by external services and platforms.
