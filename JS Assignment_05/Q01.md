Q.1 Whatâ€™s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?

Ans:  Synchronous operations require all parties involved to be present or respond in real-time. Communication happens in a sequential manner, where participants need to wait for each other's responses before proceeding. Examples of synchronous communication include phone calls, live video chats, and instant messaging.

On the other hand, asynchronous operations allow parties to participate at their own pace without real-time constraints. Participants can interact independently of each other, and they can continue with other tasks while waiting for responses. Examples of asynchronous communication include email, forums, text messages, and asynchronous online discussions.
