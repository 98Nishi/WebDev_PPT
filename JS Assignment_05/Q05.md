Q.5 What are Callbacks & Explain Callback Hell ?

Ans:Callbacks: Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, which are invoked when a specific task or asynchronous operation completes. They allow for asynchronous programming and specifying the desired behavior after the completion of the task.

Callback Hell: Callback Hell, also known as the Pyramid of Doom, occurs when multiple nested callbacks are used in asynchronous code, leading to deeply nested and hard-to-read code. It happens when asynchronous operations depend on the results of previous operations, resulting in excessive indentation and reduced code maintainability.

asyncFunction1(function (error, result1) {
  if (error) {
    // handle error
  } else {
    asyncFunction2(function (error, result2) {
      if (error) {
        // handle error
      } else {
        asyncFunction3(function (error, result3) {
          if (error) {
            // handle error
          } else {
            // use result3
          }
        });
      }
    });
  }
});
