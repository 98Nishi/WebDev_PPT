Q.4 What are the ways we have to handle Async Code in JS?

Ans: There are several techniques available to handle asynchronous code:

1. Callbacks: A traditional approach where you provide a function to be called when an asynchronous task is done.

2. Promises: A more structured way to handle asynchronous operations. Promises represent the result of an asynchronous task and allow you to chain operations using `.then()` and `.catch()`.

3. Async/await: A modern approach that makes asynchronous code look like synchronous code. It uses the `async` and `await` keywords to pause execution until a promise is resolved.

4. Event-driven programming: Handling asynchronous code based on events or user interactions by attaching event handlers to specific events.

5. Libraries and frameworks: Many JavaScript libraries and frameworks offer built-in tools and functions to simplify asynchronous code handling.
