Q.3 Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval.

Ans:setTimeout:Executes a function or code snippet once after a specified delay in milliseconds.
Example: We want to display a message on a website after 5 seconds. We can use setTimeout to wait for 5 seconds and then show the message.

setInterval:setInterval is a function that repeatedly executes a piece of code or a function at a specific interval. It takes two arguments: a callback function or code to be executed, and the interval duration (in milliseconds). The callback function will be invoked repeatedly at the specified interval until it is cleared.

Example: We want to update the time on a clock every second. We can use setInterval to run a function every second that updates the time on the clock display.
