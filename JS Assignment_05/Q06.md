Q.6 What are Promises & Explain Some Three Method of Promise?

Ans: Promises in JavaScript are objects used to handle asynchronous operations and represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous task. They provide a way to write asynchronous code that is more readable and easier to manage.

A promise can be in one of three states:

Pending: The initial state of a promise. It is neither fulfilled nor rejected.

Fulfilled: The promise has been resolved successfully with a value. This state is commonly referred to as "resolved."

Rejected: The promise encountered an error or was rejected with a reason.

Three common methods of Promises are:

1->   .then(): This method is used to handle the successful completion of a Promise. You pass a function to .then(), and it will be executed when the Promise is successfully resolved.

2.>   .catch(): This method is used to handle any errors or failures that occur during the Promise execution. You pass a function to .catch(), and it will be executed if the Promise is rejected.

3.>   .finally(): This method allows you to specify a function that will be executed regardless of whether the Promise is resolved or rejected. It is commonly used for performing cleanup tasks or finalizing actions.
