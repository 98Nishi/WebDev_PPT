Q.3 Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?

Ans:1.HTML Tags are the labels or entity that create web pages. Each tag provides special meaning for the content.
   They are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >) and typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
   For example: <p> is paragraph tag.

   2.HTML element is a combination of start tag, content and an end tag. Mostly, website content is written inside start tag ( <p>) and an end tag ( </p>).It includes both the opening and closing tags, along with the content in between.

   For example: <p>This is sample content</p> represents HTML element.
