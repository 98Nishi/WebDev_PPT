Q.8 What is the difference between <figure> tag and <img> tag?

Ans:   <figure> tag:
       The <figure> tag represents self-contained content, typically an image or illustration, accompanied by a caption or description.
       It provides a semantic structure for grouping together the media content and its associated description.
       It is often used for images, diagrams, charts, or other visual elements that require a caption or explanation.

       Example:
       <figure>
       <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">
       <figcaption>A beautiful landscape</figcaption>
       </figure>

       <img> tag:

       The <img> tag is a stand alone tag used to embed an image into an HTML document.
       It is a void element, meaning it does not require a closing tag.
       It specifies the source (src) attribute, which defines the image file to be displayed, and can include optional attributes like alt, width, and height.
       Example:
       <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">
