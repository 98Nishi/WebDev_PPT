Q.1 <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?

Ans: `<!DOCTYPE html>` is not an HTML tag. It is a document type declaration used at the   beginning of an HTML document to specify the version of HTML being used and ensure consistent rendering across browsers. It helps browsers understand the document's structure and apply appropriate parsing and rendering rules.
