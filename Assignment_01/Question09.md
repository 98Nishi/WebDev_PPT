Q.9 Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes?

Ans: The main difference between tag and attribute is that a tag is a way of representing an HTML element in the program, while an attribute is a way of describing the characteristics of an HTML element.

HTML Attribute:
     1.An HTML attribute provides additional information or modifies the behavior of an HTML element.
     2.Attributes are specified within the opening tag of an element and consist of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign (=).
     3.Attributes can be global (applicable to most HTML elements) or specific to certain elements.
Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">

 Example of some global attributes----
     1.class: Specifies class names for styling or JavaScript manipulation.
     2.id: Provides a unique identifier for an element.
     3.style: Defines inline CSS styles for an element.
     4.title: Adds a tooltip or additional information about the element.
     5.lang: Specifies the language of the element's content.
