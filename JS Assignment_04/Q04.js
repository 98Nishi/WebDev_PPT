2. Block-Scoped Variables: `let` and `const` for block-level variable scoping.
3. Classes: Simplified syntax for defining and working with classes.
4. Modules: Native support for modular code organization.
5. Template Literals: Enhanced string literals with interpolation and multi-line support.
6. Destructuring Assignment: Extracting values from arrays or objects into variables.
7. Default Parameters: Assigning default values to function parameters.
8. Spread and Rest Operators: Spreading elements of arrays/objects or representing function arguments.
