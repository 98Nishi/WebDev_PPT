Q.9 Explain Class in JavaScript?

Ans:In JavaScript, a class acts as a blueprint for creating objects with predefined properties and behaviors. It serves as a template that defines the structure and characteristics of objects. Using the `class` keyword, we can encapsulate data and methods within a class, making it easier to create multiple instances of similar objects. Objects created from a class are referred to as instances or objects of that class. Classes provide a more organized and reusable way of creating objects with consistent properties and behaviors.
