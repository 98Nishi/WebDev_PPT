Q.4 Explain OOPS ? 

Ans: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing code that organizes it into objects that have their own data and behaviors. Objects are created from templates called classes. OOP focuses on encapsulating data and functions together, allowing for code reuse and easier maintenance. It uses concepts like inheritance, which allows new classes to be based on existing ones, and polymorphism, which allows different objects to be treated in a similar way. OOP helps in writing organized, reusable, and flexible code by modeling real-world entities and their relationships.
