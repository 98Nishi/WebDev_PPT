Q.10 Whatâ€™s Super Keyword & What it does?

Ans: In JavaScript, the `super` keyword is used in child classes to refer to the parent class and access its properties and methods. It allows child classes to extend and customize the behavior inherited from the parent class while retaining the original functionality. It is commonly used to call the parent class's constructor or invoke parent class methods with the same name. The `super` keyword facilitates inheritance and promotes code reuse in object-oriented programming.
