Q.8 Whats Encapsulation and Purpose of it ?

Ans: Encapsulation in object-oriented programming is the concept of bundling data and related functions together into objects. It's purpose is to hide the internal details of an object, allowing interactions only through a well-defined interface. Encapsulation ensures data security and integrity by preventing direct access to the object's internal state. It promotes code organization, modularity, and reusability, as objects can be treated as black boxes with clearly defined interactions. Encapsulation also enables easier maintenance and modification of code, as changes to the internal implementation of an object don't affect the external code using it.
