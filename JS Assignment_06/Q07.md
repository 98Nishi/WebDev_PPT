Q.7  Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it?

Ans: Inheritance in object-oriented programming allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. Its purpose is to promote code reuse, organization, and extensibility. It enables the derived class to inherit and utilize the attributes and methods of the base class, reducing code duplication. Inheritance also allows the derived class to add its own unique attributes and behaviors, expanding the capabilities of the base class. It helps create a hierarchical structure of classes, making the code more efficient and manageable.
