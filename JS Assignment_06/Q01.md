Q.1 Whatâ€™s Constructor And Its Purpose?

Ans: A constructor is like a special recipe or blueprint that creates and initializes an object when we want to make a new one. It's like a set of instructions that puts together all the necessary parts of the object and gives them specific values. Just like a factory, the constructor ensures that the object is properly set up and ready to be used. It is automatically called when you create a new object using the object's type. The constructor's main job is to make sure the object starts off in a good and useful state by initializing its properties and variables. Without constructors, objects would be empty shells without any meaningful data or functionality. They play a crucial role in object-oriented programming by providing a way to create objects with initial values and predefined behaviors.
