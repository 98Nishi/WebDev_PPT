Q.6 Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?

Ans:  Polymorphism in object-oriented programming allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are instances of a common base class. It promotes code flexibility by enabling different objects to respond differently to the same method or function call. The purpose of polymorphism is to write more adaptable and reusable code that can work with various object types. It reduces code duplication and promotes code organization by allowing method overriding in derived classes.
