Q.5 Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?

Ans: Abstraction in object-oriented programming simplifies complex systems by focusing on essential features and hiding unnecessary details. It's purpose is to improve code readability, manage complexity, and promote modularity. Abstraction allows users to interact with objects through a simplified interface, without needing to understand the underlying implementation. It enables code reuse, enhances flexibility, and encourages conceptual clarity by creating higher-level representations of objects or systems.
