Q.2 Explain This Keyword and Its Purpose?

Ans: The "this" keyword refers to the current object in a class and is used to access its properties and methods. It helps avoid confusion when there are variables with the same name in the class. It allows the object to refer to itself and manipulate its own state. The "this" keyword is essential for maintaining object-oriented principles and ensuring proper object behavior within a class.
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;

  this.introduce = function() {
    console.log("Hi, my name is " + this.name);
  };
}

let john = new Person("John");
john.introduce();
