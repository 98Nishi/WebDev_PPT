Q.3 Whatâ€™s Call Apply Bind Method & Difference Between them?

Ans:
1. `call`:- The `call` method allows us to invoke a function and specify the context (the value of `this`) explicitly, along with individual arguments passed as comma-separated values. For example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}

greet.call(null, "John"); // Output: Hello, John
```

2. `apply`: The `apply` method is similar to `call`, but it accepts the context as the first argument and an array or an array-like object containing the function arguments as the second argument. It is particularly useful when the number of arguments is not known in advance. For example:
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}

greet.apply(null, ["John"]); // Output: Hello, John
```

3. `bind`: The `bind` method returns a new function with a specified context and partially applied arguments. It allows us to create a bound function that can be called later. The original function is not invoked immediately. 
For example:
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}

let greetJohn = greet.bind(null, "John");
greetJohn();  // Output: Hello, John
```

The key differences between `call`, `apply`, and `bind` are in how arguments are passed. `call` and `apply` both immediately invoke the function with specified arguments, while `bind` returns a new function with bound context and partially applied arguments.
